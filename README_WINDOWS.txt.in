------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supercollider ${PROJECT_VERSION} Plugins for Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installation, please uninstall any previous version of the
plugins from your system.

To install the plugins, place the SC3plugins folder into one of the
SuperCollider extension folders listed below, depending on your
operating system and installation type:

Default installation in userExtensionsDir:
    C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions

System-wide installation:
    C:\ProgramData\SuperCollider\Extensions

You can verify these locations by executing the corresponding command
from within SuperCollider.

*Note* for 32-bit version with supernova plugins: the bundle is split into two
folders, `plugins` (containing the binary plugins) and `SC3plugins` (
containing class-, help- and other files). This separation is required by
supernova. Just move both folders into any of the Extensions directories.
